Game is based on the Become A Pokemon Monster challenge from Codecademy https://www.codecademy.com/projects/practice/become-a-pokemon-master .

Purpose

I decided to go with a Gundam based version since I've been in the mood to make more Gundam related material. Works similar to a Pokemon game, but added a few features to differentiate it enough. A person can pick 2 different mobile suits and have them fight each other. I went with self healing(equivalent of healing pikemon with potions) option since there some mobile suits that have that featured like Turn A gundam. Made sure any health(amount recovered is random) recovered would not exceed the mobile suit's max health and. Added a low chance of activation to make sure the mobile suit doesn't have a huge advantage. Also a mobile suit's level would effect how much damage it would do if the enemy is a higher, lower, or even level. Critical attack has a low chance of connecting and if it does connect, theres 3 different critical levels ranging from average, good and critical.

Improvements

First thing I would want to improve is making sure the game ends as soon as a mobile suits gets destroyed. Right now it continues until the script ends. I plan on adding other options like ships and space stations. The second_hit() and crit_attack() should be combined together, seems possilbe enough. Having a user(pilot)'s expierence effect their mobile suit stats(attack, defense, accuracy maybe) is something I want to be implemented. I do plan on combing this and the flaskapi project together.
